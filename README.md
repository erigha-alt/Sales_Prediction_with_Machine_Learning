Sales Prediction with Machine Learning
Sales prediction is a crucial task for businesses to plan their marketing strategies, allocate resources efficiently, and optimize their revenue. This project focuses on predicting sales based on various factors such as advertising budgets on different channels like TV, radio, and newspapers.

Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains information about advertising budgets spent on TV, radio, and newspapers, along with corresponding sales figures. It includes 200 observations and 4 columns: TV, radio, newspaper, and sales. The data is preprocessed to handle missing values and explore relationships between variables.

Model Training
The project involves training a regression model to predict sales based on advertising budgets. Linear Regression is used as the primary algorithm due to its simplicity and interpretability. The dataset is split into training and testing sets, and the model is trained on the training data and evaluated on the testing data.

Evaluation Metrics
The performance of the trained model is evaluated using common regression metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and R-squared score. These metrics help assess the accuracy and effectiveness of the model in predicting sales based on advertising budgets.

Results
The trained Linear Regression model demonstrates good performance in predicting sales based on advertising budgets. The Mean Absolute Error (MAE) is approximately 1.47, indicating that, on average, the model's predictions are off by around 1.47 units of sales. The R-squared score is approximately 0.90, indicating that approximately 90% of the variance in sales can be explained by the advertising budgets.

Usage
To use this project:

Clone the repository to your local machine.
Run the Jupyter notebook or Python script to preprocess the data, train the model, and make predictions.
Experiment with different algorithms and hyperparameters to improve the model's performance.
